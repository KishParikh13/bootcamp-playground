# Playground space for my coding bootcamp

**https://bootcamp-playground.vercel.app/**

I am documenting my work through the course in a simple sandbox react environment, that allows me to easily edit pages and add new code.

The aim is to have a library of projects, code, and live demos that can be easily added to. The projects will include those I do in my course as well as anything else I build using the concepts from class.
